# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Classification using ResNet-50

## Project Overview
This project uses **Transfer Learning with ResNet-50** to classify images of flowers into **five categories**:  
- Daisy ðŸŒ¼  
- Dandelion ðŸŒ¾  
- Rose ðŸŒ¹  
- Sunflower ðŸŒ»  
- Tulip ðŸŒ·  

The model achieves high accuracy (~90%) and can predict unseen flower images correctly.
